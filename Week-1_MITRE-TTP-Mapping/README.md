**# 🗓️ Week 1 Summary – Cybersecurity Internship**

During Week 1 of my Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics internship, I was introduced to several fundamental concepts and tools that are crucial in the cybersecurity domain. The sessions were both informative and hands-on, helping me build a strong foundation.

**## 🔐 Topics Covered**

**### Malware Analysis:**

I learned about various types of malware such as viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, and spyware. We discussed how they function, their impact on systems, and basic techniques to detect or prevent them.

**### Digital Forensics:**

I was introduced to the field of digital forensics — understanding how digital evidence is collected, preserved, and analyzed during cyber investigations. Some real-life case studies helped me grasp the practical importance of forensics in solving cybercrimes.

**### Git & GitHub:**

I learned how to use Git for version control and how to create repositories on GitHub. This included steps to:

Initialize a repo

Add files and folders

Commit and push changes

Maintain a structured folder hierarchy for our internship tasks

## **Interesting Tools:**

We explored several cybersecurity tools (like GOO, Najdi.si, and more), and I began creating POCs (Proof of Concepts) using some of these tools to demonstrate their use in real-world scenarios.

**## 🧠 Key Takeaways**

Understanding of malware behavior and how digital evidence is handled

Awareness of real-world cybercrime cases and how investigations are conducted

Hands-on experience with GitHub and repository management

Exposure to practical cybersecurity tools and techniques

Creation of initial POCs to showcase tool usage and research
