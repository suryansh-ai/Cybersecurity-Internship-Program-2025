
MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a framework developed by MITRE, a non-profit organization, to describe and categorize the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors, such as hackers, cybercriminals, and nation-state actors.

What are MITRE maps?
<br>
MITRE maps, also known as ATT&CK matrices or heatmaps, are visual representations of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. They display the various tactics and techniques used by threat actors, organized into categories and subcategories.

Components of a MITRE map
1. Tactics: High-level objectives, such as reconnaissance, exploitation, or persistence.
2. Techniques: Specific methods used to achieve a tactic, such as phishing, spear phishing, or drive-by compromise.
3. Sub-techniques: More detailed descriptions of techniques, providing additional context.
4. Procedure examples: Real-world examples of how threat actors have used specific techniques.

Uses of MITRE maps
1. Threat intelligence: To analyze and understand the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors.
2. Vulnerability assessment: To identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in an organization's defenses.
3. Incident response: To quickly identify and respond to ongoing attacks.
4. Security testing: To evaluate an organization's defenses against known threats.
5. Training and education: To educate security professionals on the latest threat actor TTPs.

By using MITRE maps, security professionals can better understand the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by threat actors, ultimately improving their ability to detect, prevent, and respond to cyber threats.

## Threat Overview  
Brief summary of the observed activity. Describe the environment, any alerts triggered, or notable adversary behavior.  

## Notes & Next Steps  

- Validate detected techniques using forensic tools like Autopsy or FTK Imager.  
- Run additional scans for lateral movement traces.  
- Update YARA rules based on recent threat samples.  
- Prepare evidence pack and submit to mentor for review.
